Petrified
A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious.
If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed.

Pinned
A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions.
A pinned creature cannot move and is denied its Dexterity bonus.
A pinned character also takes an additional â€“4 penalty to his Armor Class.
A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take.
A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check.
A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component.
A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grapplerâ€™s CMB + spell level) or lose the spell.
Pinned is a more severe version of grappled, and their effects do not stack.




Prone
The character is lying on the ground.
A prone attacker has a â€“4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow).
A prone defender gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a â€“4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.
