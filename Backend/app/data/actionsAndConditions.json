Pinned
A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions.

A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take.
A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check.
A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component.
A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler’s CMB + spell level) or lose the spell.
Pinned is a more severe version of grappled, and their effects do not stack.
