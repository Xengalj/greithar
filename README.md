# Greithar

This is my site for Pathfinder.


## Technical Setup


### Backend setup

1. Open the project and open Greithar/Backend/app/server.js
2. Change reSeed to 1 on line 9 to have the server seed the DB

3. Then open a cmd prompt in `Greithar/Backend`, then run the following commands
```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

If you run into errors, you may need to run one of the following
```sh
npm update
npm audit fix --force
```

>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    From bezkoder.


### Frontend Setup
Start by opening a cmd prompt in `Greithar/Frontend`, then run the following commands
```sh
npm install
npm run serve
```

If you run into errors, you may need to run one of the following
```sh
npm update
npm audit fix --force
```

> This part of the project was built off of [vue-3-authentication-jwt](https://github.com/bezkoder/vue-3-authentication-jwt)  
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    From bezkoder.


## Deployment
You may also build the front end into the back end.
1. Open a cmd prompt in `Greithar/Frontend`, then run the following command
```sh
npm run build
```

> This will build the frontend files into a new `/views` dir in the backend.

2. Then open a cmd prompt in `Greithar/Backend` and run the following
```sh
node server.js
```

### SSL (Server)
On the server run:

`certbot -d greithar.mqt.dev --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly`

This command will output a TXT record to add to the DNS server. Add the associated TXT record in Namecheap and wait a few minutes. Check propagation with Google, note other DNS servers don't respect the TTL but Certbot will check with Google first.

After verifying the record, restart apache with `service apache2 restart`. Certbot should already place the new key files in the old location, so not server configuration changes should be required.

## Run in Development
1. Run Laragon to host MySQL
2. Run `node server.js` from `Greithar/Backend` to host the backend and API
3. Run `npm run serve` from `Greithar/Frontend` to host frontend
